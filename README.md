# Semester-Project

Overview:  
For our Semester Project, we plan to create a simple web browser. Because building a web browser from scratch is incredibly complex, we plan to make use of the JavaFX WebView class to display web content. The following features will be implemented: a url address bar, back/forward/refresh/stop buttons, a bookmarks list, search field, and pop-up handler. A database will be maintained for storing and retrieving user preferences (custom GUI design), favorite urls, homepages, perhaps user feedback/stats etc. This web browser should be able to handle HTML and JavaScript without problems.

Instructions:  
1. Run Database.Java once to create the database.  
2. Run App.java thereafter to use the browser.
